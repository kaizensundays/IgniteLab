\par
### Entity Relationships\par
\par
Here\rquote s how the entities interact, forming the backbone of the system:\par
\par
- **Flight \f1\u8596?\f0  Airline**: A Flight is operated by one Airline; an Airline operates many Flights (1:M).\par
- **Flight \f1\u8596?\f0  Airport**: A Flight has one Departure Airport and one Arrival Airport; an Airport is associated with many Flights (1:M).\par
- **Flight \f1\u8596?\f0  Seat**: A Flight has many Seats; a Seat belongs to one Flight (1:M).\par
- **Flight \f1\u8596?\f0  Price**: A Flight has multiple Price options (e.g., by cabin class); a Price is tied to one Flight (1:M).\par
- **Flight \f1\u8596?\f0  Booking**: A Flight can have many Bookings; a Booking is for one Flight (1:M).\par
- **User \f1\u8596?\f0  Booking**: A User can make many Bookings; a Booking is made by one User (1:M).\par
- **Booking \f1\u8596?\f0  Passenger**: A Booking can include multiple Passengers; a Passenger is part of one Booking (1:M).\par
- **Booking \f1\u8596?\f0  Payment**: A Booking has one Payment; a Payment is associated with one Booking (1:1).\par
- **Booking \f1\u8596?\f0  Itinerary**: An Itinerary can include multiple Bookings; a Booking belongs to one Itinerary (M:1).\par
- **User \f1\u8596?\f0  Itinerary**: A User can have multiple Itineraries; an Itinerary belongs to one User (1:M).\par
- **Promotion \f1\u8596?\f0  Booking**: A Promotion can be applied to multiple Bookings; a Booking can use one Promotion (M:1).\par
- **Schedule \f1\u8596?\f0  Flight**: A Schedule defines recurring Flights; a Flight is an instance of a Schedule (1:M).\par
\par
---\par
\par
### Additional Considerations\par
\par
- **Search Functionality**: The system needs to support queries based on Departure/Arrival Airports, Dates, Times, Cabin Class, and Price. This requires efficient indexing of Flight, Airport, and Price entities.\par
- **Dynamic Pricing**: The Price entity supports dynamic pricing based on demand, time, or promotions, requiring real-time updates.\par
- **Multi-City Itineraries**: The Itinerary entity handles complex trips by linking multiple Bookings, supporting multi-city or round-trip searches.\par
- **User Roles**: The User entity can include roles like Customer, Admin, or Agent, affecting access to features (e.g., Admins manage Flights, Agents book for others).\par
- **External Integrations**: Entities like Payment and Airport may integrate with external systems (e.g., payment gateways, global airport databases).\par
- **Scalability**: Entities like Flight and Booking need to handle high volumes, requiring optimized database design (e.g., partitioning by date or region).\par
- **Localization**: Attributes like Price (currency) and Airport (time zone) support internationalization.\par
\par

### Diagram Representation\par
\par
To visualize the relationships, a simplified Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) would look like this (in text form):\par
\par
```\par
[User] --1:M--> [Booking] --1:M--> [Passenger]\par
  |                |\par
1:M               1:1\par
  |                |\par
[Itinerary]    [Payment]\par
  |\par
1:M\par
[Flight] --1:M--> [Seat]\par
  |          1:M\par
  |----1:M--> [Price]\par
  |          1:M\par
[Airline]    [Promotion]\par
  |          1:M\par
[Airport]   [Schedule]\par
```\par
\par
---\par
\par
### Notes on Implementation\par
\par
- **Database Design**: Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) with tables for each entity, foreign keys for relationships, and indexes for frequent search fields (e.g., Flight Departure Date, Airport Code).\par
- **API Endpoints**: Design RESTful APIs for search (e.g., `/flights/search`), booking (e.g., `/bookings`), and payment (e.g., `/payments`).\par
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data like Airport codes or Schedule to improve search performance.\par
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity (e.g., validate Seat availability before Booking, ensure Payment completion).\par
- **Security**: Secure User data (e.g., encrypt Payment Information) and implement authentication for User actions.\par
